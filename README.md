## fx-jni
***
This is a demo application showcasing the usage of the "fx-jni" library,
which allows custom window styles when using Javafx on Windows.

## Overview

The "fx-jni" library facilitates the interaction between JavaFX 
applications and native code, making it possible to leverage
native capabilities within a JavaFX application, like custom window styles,
creating custom themes, etc.
This demo serves as a simple example to demonstrate the library's capabilities.

### Features

* Native behaviour & native tooltips.
* Ability to set custom Stage styles.
* Ability to 100% integrate themes, not only for the javafx nodes, also for the Stage itself.
* Show/Hide Stage from the TaskBar.
* Set Stage corner's preferences.
* The Decoration implementation introduces a new way to handle window states(Minimized/Normal/Maximized).
* Ability to set a visibility delay before showing the Stage.
* An easy way to set you own custom HitTestSpots, very util for adding controls in the window's non client area.
* Very low memory usage.
